 *       Sparse is available for a charge (subject to change).  The package
 *  includes the source code on tape, the user's guide and a paper that
 *  discusses techniques for solving sparse systems of equations [1].  To
 *  obtain ordering information for Sparse and other programs, contact:

 *
 *       The University often does not have the resources to consult with 
 *  users on how to use or modify these programs.  We would, however, like 
 *  to be notified of any problems or errors in the material provided and 
 *  appreciate copies on tape of any troublesome matrices.  If the program 
 *  is enhanced or converted to run on other systems, we would like to receive
 *  copies of the modified program so that it can be made available to the 
 *  public.

 *  >>> History:
 *  Revision 1.1  January 1985
 *      Initial release.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1a  20 March 1985
 *      Modified DecomposeMatrix() and OrderAndDecomposeMatrix() so that
 *      the parameters Growth, PseudoCondition and LargestElement may be 
 *      given as NULL.
 *
 *  Revision 1.1b  28 March 1985
 *      Corrected a bug that caused OrderAndDecomposeMatrix() to reorder
 *      the matrix every time it was called.  Also made many of the global
 *      variables defined in MtrxDecom.c static.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  October 1985
 *      This new version of Sparse is meant to make it more compatible
 *      with interactive circuit simulators.  In it the TRANSLATE
 *      option was added, along with the ability to access the matrix
 *      with AddElementToMatrix() and AddAdmittanceToMatrix() after it
 *      has been reordered.  Also added were the DeleteRowAndColFromMatrix(),
 *      CleanMatrix(), GetMatrixSize(), SetMatrixReal() and SetMatrixComplex()
 *      routines.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2a  April 1986
 *      Fixed a bug that caused the matrix frame to get freed twice and one
 *      in the test program that caused sparse to crash when a complex matrix
 *      with no source vector was attempted.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2b  July 1986
 *      Modified the test routine so that it allocates vectors from the heap
 *      rather than the stack.
 *
 *  Revision 1.2c  February 1987
 *      Fixed off-by-one error in PreorderForModifiedNodal().
 *
 *  Revision 1.2d
 *      Modified the pivot selection algorithm so that singletons also meet
 *      numerical threshold criterion.  Deleted some global variables.  Modified
 *      test program to add command line options among other things.  Made 
 *      thresholds sticky, so that once a valid threshold has been specified
 *      for a particular matrix, it becomes the new default.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3a  July 1988
 *      Made numerous changes.  Highlights are:
 *      Routine names shortened and made unique to 8 characters.
 *      Unordering factorization is faster.
 *      Added self initialization feature.
 *      Sparse now aborts on errors that should not occur.
 *      Cleaned up test program.
 *      Separated growth and pseudocondition calculations from factorization.
 *      Added LINPACK condition number estimator.
 *      Rewrote spMNA_Preorder, algorithm extended to fix inadequacies.
 *      Eliminated all global variables.
 *      Added DIAGONAL_PIVOTING option (only diagonal pivoting before).
 *
 *  Revision 1.3b  August 1988
 *      Added function declarations at the top of each file.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3c  January 1989
 *      Fixed bug in spFactor.c:SearchForSingleton that caused the program
 *      to crash when looking for a singleton in a row or column in the
 *      reduced submatrix that has no elements.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3d  June 1989
 *      Compatibility to Spice3c1 added.
 *      Added spErrorMessage() error message printing function.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3e  March 1990
 *      Fixed bug that caused sparse to crash when using spMultiply() or
 *      spMultTransposed() before the matrix had been factored once.
 *      Compatibility to Spice3d1 added.
 *
 *  Revision 1.3f  March 1991
 *      Compatibility to Spice3e1 added.
