# Default definitions

###  To Edit This File:  The contents of this file are used by the "make"
###	command, and follow the syntax rules for Unix "make".  Long lines
###	can be split by placing a '\' at the end of one line and
###	continuing on the following line.  If you have any quote marks
###	or other special shell "metacharacters" they should be escaped
###	via a backslash.  Variables identified below as text strings will be
###	quoted, so quote marks are not normally required (in fact they
###	may be confusing).
###
###	If you get the error "make: syntax error at line nnn", it is likely
###	that you made an error in this file or the system specific file.
###	The most common error is to forget to continue a line with the '\'.
###
###	Comments, such as this, start at the beginning of a line with '#'
###	and stop at the end of a line.  When changing the following values
###	you should save the original values by inserting '#' at the beginning
###	of the line.

###	The definitions below are group in to four areas:
###
###		1.  Directory organization.  These definitions tell where
###			to store the final executables, data files, and
###			intermediate (".o") files.
###
###		2.  X11 options.  These definitions are provided to
###			accommodate X11 if it is not installed with
###			the regular system software.
###
###		3.  Compiler/System options.  You will want to leave most if
###			not all of these as they are; any exceptions should
###			probably be put in a per-system file.
###
###		4.  SPICE configuration options.  These definitions indicate
###			what goes in to your version of spice.
###


###	Directory Organization
###
###

#       TOP0, TOP1, TOP2, TOP3, and TOP4 are the distribution directory,
#	it's parent directory, the parent's parent, and so on, respectively.
#	These are normally set during the build with the 'pwd' command.  If
#	you use symbolic links or an automounter to hide the physical
#	location of the source or installed executables, the result of
#	"pwd" in the distribution directory will not be correct.  At Berkeley,
#	the directory names are correct until two levels above the
#	distribution, so we only set TOP2 and the affect propagates to TOP1
#	and TOP0.  Only TOP1 and TOP0 are used.
#
#	Normally you will simply want leave the next line commented out.

# TOP2		= /projects/spice3

#	SYS_DIR is the top of all system specific files and subdirectories.
#	At Berkeley, we keep the distribution in "spice3/common/", and machine
#	dependant files in "spice3/<system>/" (for example, sun4 binaries
#	are in "spice3/sun4/bin/").  Note that at Berkeley, "spice3/" is one
#	level above the distributed directory; this is pre-defined as TOP1.
#
#	If you wish to ignore this multiple-system directory structure, use
#	the following definition:
#		SYS_DIR		= $(DIST_DIR)

SYS_DIR		= $(TOP1)/$(SYSTEM)

#	OBJ_TOP is the directory in which intermidiate files reside
#	These are ".o" files, synthesized ".c" files, ".a" files,
#	and executables (before being installed).
#
#	If you want to keep ".o" files next to the corresponding ".c" files,
#	use this definition:
#		OBJ_TOP		= $(DIST_DIR)/src
#	Even if you are not using a different SYS_DIR for system specific
#	files, you may want to use the definition below for easy clean-up.
#	(If you keep getting an error message something like "don't know how
#	to make xyz.c", you may have to use the above definition).

OBJ_TOP		= $(SYS_DIR)/obj

#	SPICE_DIR is used in definitions below; it is a common
#	installation directory for spice and related data files.
#	"S_SPICE_DIR" is where the spice executable looks for
#	"SPICE_DIR"; they should normally refer to the same place.
#	The difference is that S_SPICE_DIR expands '~' (tilde) where
#	SPICE_DIR does not allow '~'.
#
#	"S_SPICE_DIR" is also useful for cross compiling.  For example,
#	on the PC "S_SPICE_DIR" is set to "D:spice3".  For compiling
#	for people that do not have my directory arrangement, I can set
#	"SPICE_DIR" to "/tmp/spicedist" and "S_SPICE_DIR" to whatever
#	is appropriate for them.  The "install" procedure will then
#	copy a binary distribution of spice3 compiled for thier directory
#	arrangement into "/tmp/spicedist".
#
#	"SPICE_LIB_DIR" and "SPICE_EXEC_DIR" are the locations for
#	data files and executable programs, respectively.
#	"S_SPICE_LIB_DIR" and "S_SPICE_EXEC_DIR" are logical parallels,
#	as above.
#
#	Note that VERSION is pre-defined to whatever this release is
#	identified as and SYSTEM is the name of the per-system definitions
#	file listed on the "build" command line.

SPICE_DIR	= $(TOP1)/$(SYSTEM)
SPICE_LIB_DIR	= $(SPICE_DIR)/lib
SPICE_EXEC_DIR	= $(SPICE_DIR)/bin

S_SPICE_DIR	= $(SPICE_DIR)
S_SPICE_LIB_DIR	= $(S_SPICE_DIR)/lib
S_SPICE_EXEC_DIR= $(S_SPICE_DIR)/bin

#	INSTALL_DIRS lists the directories that need to be created before
#	installing the various spice files.  No harm is done if these
#	directories already exist.

INSTALL_DIRS	= $(SPICE_DIR) $(SPICE_EXEC_DIR) $(SPICE_LIB_DIR)



###	Compiler/System options
###
###

#	CC is your C compiler; note that gcc and the VAX (either one) require
#	an extra definition to work around the same strange bug.  See either
#	file "conf/vax" or "conf/gcc".

CC		= cc

#	CC_OPT: Default compile options (optimization/debug level, other)

CC_OPT		= -O

#	CC_OPT_SAFE: Special compile options to override CC_OPT for code
#	which typically causes problems for most compilers (bsim1 and bsim2).
#	CC_OPT_SAFE defaults to CC_OPT, so you normally won't have to put
#	in anything here (unless your compiler gives up on you for
#	bsim1 or bsim2).  (This should probably be put in the system specific
#	file but I want to document it here.)
#
#	CC_OPT_SAFE	= -g

#	LDFLAGS lists the options to the C compiler for linking.
#	By default, the math library and the termcap library are linked.
#	Some systems will either not have '-ltermlib' or will have it
#	included with the standard system (aix).  You should change
#	this in the system-dependent file, not here.

LDFLAGS		= -lm -ltermlib

#	GETOPTLIB is the library name that contains the function "getopt".
#	Most systems have this built in, so it is blank.

GETOPTLIB	=

#	RANLIB is the command to prepare libraries for linking.  On some
#	systems you must use "ar ts" for this, and on other systems ranlib
#	is superfluous and RANLIB can be assigned to "echo".  You may wish
#	to change this only in the system specific file

RANLIB		= ranlib

#	ARLOCAL is used to make the AR command use the current directory
#	for temporary storage instead of the systems standard temporary
#	file space.  This is useful if there is more disk space in the
#	spice3 source directory than in /tmp.  Set to 'l' (lowercase 'L')
#	to use the source directory, otherwise leave blank.

ARLOCAL		= l

#	DEPEND_PROG is the command to generate dependencies from '.c' files
#	(for "make depend").  Output should be of the form "x11.o: fte.h".

DEPEND_PROG	= cc -M

#	CLEANASYOUGO indicates whether or not you want to have '.o' files
#	removed after they are used.  Set to "true" if you are tight on disk
#	space and expect Spice3 to be built correctly the first time.  Set
#	to false otherwise.  (With "CLEANASYOUGO" set to "false", a full build
#	takes 27Mb on a DECstation).  WARNING: this confuses "build install";
#	if you set "CLEANASYOUGO", run "build install" from "src/bin" and
#	"lib", separately, and _not_ from the top directory.

CLEANASYOUGO	= false



###	X11 options;  these need to be defined if you want the X11
###	interface (see above).  Note that they should be blank if you
###	do not have X11.
###
###	The following is configured for X11R4 as distributed by MIT.
###	Spice3 requires the "Athena Widgets" toolkit.  This toolkit
###	is not normally distributed as supported software by most
###	workstation vendors; for example, in Ultrix 4 this toolkit is
###	part of "Unsupported X11 components"; AIX is similar.
###

#	X_DIR indicates the top of the X11 lib/include hierarchy; it is only
#	a convenience that is used in the following definitions.

X_DIR		= /usr

#	INCX lists the X include directories.  This may be different between
#	MIT X11r5, X11r4, and your vendor's version of X11, though listing
#	more doesn't hurt.

INCX    	= -I$(X_DIR)/include -I$(X_DIR)/include/X11		      \
		  -I$(X_DIR)/include/X11/Xmu				      \
		  -I$(X_DIR)/include/X11/Xaw

#	LIBX lists the options for linking with the X11 libraries.  Order is
#	also important.  Note that "-lXext" is an "X extensions" library
#	which is not available with all versions of X11.  If you do not have
#	it, then you do not need it (delete the following reference to it).

LIBX		= -L$(X_DIR)/lib -lXaw -lXt -lXext -lXmu -lX11




###
###	SPICE configuration options.  These affect what variation of spice3
###	you build.  They may be changed with minimal recompilation.
###

#	DEVICES lists the types of devices that you want to use in your
#	copy of Spice3.  For a smaller binary, reduce the number of devices.
#	Some systems may have trouble building the "bsim1" and/or "bsim2".
#	It does not make sense to remove any of cap, cccs, ccvs, ind, isrc,
#	res, vccs, vcvs, or vsrc.
#		asrc:	arbitrary voltage/current source
#		bjt:	bipolar junction transistor
#		bsim1:	MOS model
#		bsim2:	MOS model
#		cap:	capacitor
#		cccs:	current-controlled current source
#		ccvs:	current-controlled voltage source
#		csw:	current controlled switch
#		dio:	diode
#		ltra:	lossy transmission line
#		ind:	inductor
#		isrc:	current source
#		jfet:	Junction FET
#		mes:	MES FET (GaAs)
#		mos1:	MOS, simplest analytic model
#		mos2:	MOS, simplest
#		mos3:	MOS, simplest
#		mos6: 	MOS, fast analytic, short-channel
#		res:	resistor
#		sw:	switch
#		tra:	lossless transmission line
#		urc:	uniform RC line
#		vccs:	voltage-controlled current source
#		vcvs:	voltage-controlled voltage source
#		vsrc:	voltage source

DEVICES		= asrc bjt bsim1 bsim2 cap cccs ccvs csw dio ind isrc \
		  jfet ltra mes mos1 mos2 mos3 mos6 res sw tra urc \
		  vccs vcvs vsrc

#	ANALYSES list the analysis types that you want to have available in
#	Spice3.  As with DEVICES, this can reduce the size of the resulting
#	simulator.  Analyses op, dc, tf, ac, and tran are basic.  Analyses are:
#		op:	Operating point
#		dc:	DC transfer curve
#		tf:	Small signal transfer function
#		ac:	AC (frequency domain)
#		tran:	transient
#		pz:	pole-zero
#		disto:	distortion
#		noise:	noise
#		sense:  ac/dc all-parameter sensitivity

ANALYSES	= op dc tf ac tran pz disto noise sense

#	INTERFACE_OPTS are options to 'cc' (the C compiler) that include
#	code for either or both MFB (a terminal independent graphics
#	interface) or X11.

INTERFACE_OPTS	= -DWANT_MFB -DWANT_X11

#	BUGADDR is the e-mail address to send bug reports.  If left blank
#	the "bug" command in spice will not operate.

BUG_ADDR 	=

#	DEFAULT_EDITOR lists where the default editor used by the "edit"
#	command is located.

DEFAULT_EDITOR	= vi

#	ASCII_RAWFILE indicates that the default format of the spice3 raw data
#	file should be in human-readable format ( = 1 ) or in the smaller,
#	machine-dependent binary format.

ASCII_RAWFILE	= 0

#	OPT_CHAR is the character used on the command line to indicate
#	an option.  On most systems it is '-'; on the PC some may want
#	to use '/'.

OPT_CHAR	= -

###
###	The End.   Use the 'build' command in util/ to build spice.
