A note when using dbx (under unix-type operating systems) to debug spice3:

To avoid a segmentation fault in the initial run, use the following command
in dbx:
	setenv SPICE_NO_DATASEG_CHECK "1"
Or, the comparable command in your shell before running dbx.  This
disable accurate tracking of how much memory is used.
