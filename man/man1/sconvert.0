NAME
     sconvert - convert spice formats

SYNOPSIS
     sconvert fromtype fromfile totype tofile
     sconvert fromtype totype
     sconvert

DESCRIPTION
     Sconvert translates spice output files among three formats:
     the old binary format, a new binary format, and a new ascii
     format.  The formats are specified by the fromtype and
     totype arguments: `o' for the old format, `b' for the new
     binary format, and `a' for the new ascii format.  Fromtype
     specifies the format to be read, and totype specifies the
     format to be written.  If fromfile and tofile are given,
     then they are used as the input and output, otherwise stan-
     dard input and output are used.  (Note that this second
     option is only available on UNIX systems - on VMS and other
     systems you must supply the filenames.) If no arguments are
     given, the parameters are prompted for.

     Binary format is the preferred format for general use, as it
     is the most economical in terms of space and speed of
     access, and ascii is provided to make it easy to modify data
     files and transfer them between machines with different
     floating-point formats.  The old format is provided only for
     backward compatibility. The three formats are as follows:

     Old:

          title                    80
          date                8
          time                8
          numoutputs               2
          the integer 4            2
          variable names --
               char[numoutputs][8] numoutputs * 8
          types of output               numoutputs * 2
          node index               numoutputs * 2
          plot title               numoutputs * 24
          the actual data               numpoints * numoutputs * 8

     Ascii:

          Title: _T_i_t_l_e _C_a_r_d _S_t_r_i_n_g
          Date: _D_a_t_e
          [ Plotname: _P_l_o_t _N_a_m_e
            Flags: _c_o_m_p_l_e_x or _r_e_a_l
            No. Variables: _n_u_m_o_u_t_p_u_t_s



                                                                1

            No. Points: _n_u_m_p_o_i_n_t_s
            Command: _n_u_t_m_e_g _c_o_m_m_a_n_d

              1     n    n    n    n    ...
              And so forth...
          ] repeated one or more times


     If one of the flags is _c_o_m_p_l_e_x, the points look like r,i where r and i
     are floating point (in %e format). Otherwise they are in %e format.
     Only one of _r_e_a_l and _c_o_m_p_l_e_x should appear.

     The lines are guaranteed to be less than 80 columns wide (unless the
     plot title or variable names are very long), so this format is safe
     to mail between systems like CMS.

     Any number of Command: lines may appear between the No. Points:
     and the Variables: lines, and whenever the plot is loaded into
     nutmeg they will be executed.

     Binary:

     A set of outputs is a vector of doubles of length numoutputs, or
     a vector of real-imaginary pairs of doubles if the data is complex.

BUGS
     If variable names and the title and plotname strings have
     trailing blanks in them they will be stripped off when the

     file is read, if it is in ascii format.

     If a plot title begins with "Title:" nutmeg will be fooled
     into thinking that this is an ascii format file. Sconvert
     always requires the type to be specified, however.
